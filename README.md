# Filewalker
Filewalker is a program I created to scratch an itch I had; it essentially allows the user to specify a root directory 
and then displays all the files in that directory and its sub-directories. You can copy files, delete and sort them based
on filename, size, and creation date. Nothing special, but solves the problem I had. 

It's written in C#, using .NET 4.5 and is released under the MIT license.
